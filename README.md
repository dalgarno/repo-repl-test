# dse-tech-test

Welcome!

In this section we are going to be doing some practical coding.

## Environment

We are using the online collaborative IDE [repl.it](repl.it), which runs in the browser.

It can be customised using the `Settings` button on the left hand pane, so please feel free to take some time to ensure the font size, theme, etc. are comfortable for you.

We will be using `Python` as the programming language.

There are a small number of packages pre-installed in the environment; if you would like to use another package, you should be able to do so with `import <my_package>` and the environment will automatically install it.

There is a main editing pane on the left, and a terminal on the right.

## The task

There is an API available at: https://dse-test-api.herokuapp.com/

> To start, we would like you to print the total number of cases for each country.
